### History

Planet’s been around since 1983. [Read about the Kenmore store and more](/about/history).

### What We Do

We make the most of our space. You can find a ton of quality material in our well-organized bins. CDs and LPs form the bulk of our inventory, but we also carry DVDs and 45s, plus smaller sections of books, blu-rays and even laserdiscs. (We don’t carry audio cassettes or VHS tapes.)

We’ve added more room for vinyl to meet the recent increase in demand. The New Arrivals section moves quickly, so many customers visit several times a week to make sure they don’t miss something they’ve been hunting down.

As for CDs, we might be the last store in the region to have a truly broad CD department with substantial and deep jazz and classical collections. Fans of blues, bluegrass, folk, New Orleans music, country and other American traditions will always leave with something special. Of course the coverage extends to popular music, rock, and R+B. Other specializations (lounge, electronica, experimental music, soundtracks, a diverse international section, etc) are kept well-stocked.

Despite being a primarily used shop, about a sixth of our CD inventory is new, sealed items. We also maintain a (mostly separate) inventory online, using [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/zzy49), [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/seller/PlanetRecords/profile) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A3AFXHL86TBAH4&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER) to reach mail-order customers around the world. Some of our local customers bid on auctions as well, so in-store pick-ups for online sales are welcome.

Collectors also stop in to stock up on music library accessories like polybags, inner sleeves, jewel cases and LP mailers.

### Record Shopping in Harvard Square

Harvard Square is a great place to go record hunting: Planet Records, [Armageddon](http://www.armageddonshopboston.com/index_boston.php), and [In Your Ear](http://iye.com/html_index.cfm?page=about) (which has another location in Boston, as well) are all only a few blocks apart. Regional clothing / tchotchke chain [Newbury Comics](https://www.newburycomics.com/) is here, too, and they still sell some records in their "trends" section (side eye). [Stereo Jacks](http://stereojacks.com/) is just a fifteen minute walk up Mass Ave and [Cheapo](http://www.cheaporecords.com/) is one T-stop (or a 20 minute walk) in the opposite direction. They’re all great shops worth visiting. At our store, we provide a free Record Store Guide detailing locations, descriptions and contact info for these locations and others — an excellent resource for muso tourists passing through town.
