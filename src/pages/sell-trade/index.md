Planet always has buyers on duty and we’re happy to look at anything you bring in. We see many collections every week though and you should know a little about the process before you come by.

* We buy vinyl (LPs and 7"s), some CDs, Cassettes, DVDs and blu-rays.
* We buy some music-related books, posters, etc.
* We buy music-related memorabilia, like T-shirts and accessories.
* We don’t usually buy VHS tapes. There may be exceptions for unusual items.
* We don’t buy discs with missing artwork.
* We occasionally buy Americana (folk, blues, and gospel etc.) on 78 RPM

Title and condition are the factors that determine our interest. The majority of titles that we could potentially use are only candidates when they’re in excellent condition. We evaluate item-by-item; we don’t purchase lots as such.

**We want your LP collection**. We can purchase all genres of music. Rock, R&B, Jazz, Blues, International, Reggae, Country, Folk, Classical, Experimental and many others are all candidates for our inventory. (We rarely buy easy listening, mainstream big band or pop vocal - OK, we'll buy Frank). Audiophile releases, unusual recordings and contemporary composers can be exceptions. 

We have been inundated with CDs over the past few years so we can't use everything. We’re looking for music in all genres in excellent condition. As a result we are very selective about what we can buy. In general the more mainstream (common) the artists, the less likely we are to be able to buy their CDs but there are always exceptions. We can usually use reggae, blues, some jazz, international, ethnic collections. We look for box sets, Japanese pressings and other collectibles.

We buy interesting cassettes.

We buy all kinds of DVDs and Blu Rays. We focus on classic movies, foreign films, some TV series, music DVDs and offbeat titles. We especially appreciate Criterion and other high quality versions of films. We’re more likely to buy items with niche interest than blockbuster Hollywood films.

If you want to bring in over 50 items, we suggest calling first (617-492-0693). While you don’t need an appointment, on very busy days there may be a wait. For larger collections you shoulkd make an appointment. We don’t keep anything over night, so if you drop off a collection and leave, please be sure that you can come back later the same day.
