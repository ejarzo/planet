title: Selling & Trading Your Stuff

### 

Planet always has buyers on duty and we’re happy to look at anything you bring in. We see a lot of stuff these days, though, and you should know a little about the process before you come by.

* We buy vinyl (LPs and 7"s), CDs, Cassettes, DVDs and blu-rays.
* We buy some music-related books, posters, etc.
* We buy music-related memorabilia, like T-shirts and accessories.
* We don’t usually buy VHS tapes. There may be exceptions for unusual items.
* We don’t buy discs with missing artwork.
* We occasionally buy Americana (folk, blues, and gospel etc.) on 78 RPM

Title and condition are the factors that determine our interest. The majority of titles that we could potentially use are only candidates when they’re in excellent condition. We only evaluate item-by-item; we don’t purchase lots as such.

**We want your LP collection**. We can purchase all genres. We rarely buy easy listening, mainstream big band or pop vocal. Audiophile releases, unusual recordings and contemporary composers can be exceptions. 

With CDs we’re looking for music in all genres in excellent condition. However we have been overwhelmed by the number of incoming CD collections over the past few years. As a result we are very selective about what we can buy. In general the more mainstream (common) the artists, the less likely we are to be able to buy their CDs but there are always exceptions.

We buy interesting cassettes.

We buy all kinds of DVDs and Blu Rays. We focus on classic movies, foreign films, some TV series, music DVDs and offbeat titles. We’re much more likely to buy items with niche interest than blockbuster Hollywood films.

If you want to bring in over 50 items, we suggest calling first (617 492-0693). While you don’t need an appointment, on very busy days there may be a wait. We don’t keep anything over night, so if you drop off a collection and leave, please be sure that you can come back later the same day.
