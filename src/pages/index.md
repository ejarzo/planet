  Found today at [144 Mt. Auburn St, Cambridge, MA](/location-hours), Planet
  Records was established in 1983 in Kenmore Square as a record lover’s
  destination. Planet Records offers a wide selection of quality LPs, CDs and
  DVDs and music books. Our high standards for condition and selection have
  enabled Planet Records to survive floods, fire, and the self-inflicted
  implosion of the record industry. We are recognized as a go-to destination for
  collectors and casual buyers because we care. Our high standards are reflected
  in our stock and we curate an inventory that is always enticing.


  [Planet is open 7 days a week](/location-hours) and every day fresh inventory
  is added to the already tempting stock. All genres are represented, reflecting
  a depth that most stores can’t match.


  Our staff is ready to help! We have buyers on duty most of the time, ready to
  offer [cash of trade](/sell-trade) for your collection. Please call first as
  sometimes appointments are necessary.
