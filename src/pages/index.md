  Found today at [144 Mt. Auburn St, Cambridge, MA](/location-hours), Planet
  Records was established in 1983 in Kenmore Square as a record lover’s
  destination. Planet Records offers a wide selection of quality LPs, CDs and
  DVDs. Our high standards for condition and selection have enabled Planet
  Records to survive floods, fire, and the self-inflicted implosion of the
  record industry. We are recognized as a go-to destination for collectors and
  casual buyers.


  [Planet is open 7 days a week](/location-hours) and every day fresh inventory
  is added to the already tempting stock. All genres are represented, reflecting
  a depth that most stores can’t match.


  Our staff is ready to help! We have buyers on duty at all times, ready to
  offer [cash of trade](/sell-trade) for your collection.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
