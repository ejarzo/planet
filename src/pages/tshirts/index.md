  There are four Planet T-shirts to choose from. To declare your proud
  ‘University of Vinyl’ alumnus status, we’ve got more than just the shirt. For
  freshman and PhD alike, we’ll print a custom ‘Bachelor of Record Collecting’
  diploma with the name you specify. We’ve also got a University of Vinyl decal
  for your rear windshield and a Euro-style ‘VINYL’ bumper sticker.


  You can order by phone (617 492 0693) or email us if you’d like us to issue a
  Paypal invoice.

      While the University of Vinyl is a non-accredited metaphor, the diploma
      ($5) currently represents a much better return on your investment than one
      acquired through formal schooling.
