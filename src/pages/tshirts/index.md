  There are four Planet T-shirts to choose from. Shirts are $15, except size
  XXL, which is $17.


  To declare your proud ‘University of Vinyl’ alumnus status, we’ve got more
  than just the shirt. For freshman and PhD alike, we’ll print a custom
  ‘Bachelor of Record Collecting’ diploma with the name you specify.


  We’ve also got a University of Vinyl decal for your rear windshield and a
  Euro-style ‘VINYL’ bumper sticker (both $5). You can order by phone (617 492
  0693) or email us if you’d like us to issue a Paypal invoice.

      While the University of Vinyl is a non-accredited metaphor, the diploma
      ($5) currently represents a much better return on your investment than one
      acquired through formal schooling.
