**Can I buy something online to pick up at the store in person?**\
Yes. You can pay at the store, too. Feel free to call to have us put anything from our online inventory on hold. The only exceptions are active eBay auctions (as opposed to buy-it-now listings). While you can still pay for and pick up auction items in the store, you have to win them first.

**Do you buy/sell cassettes? VHS tapes? 78s?**\
We don’t, generally. Exceptions are made for unusual and rare items. On 78, the genres that are more likely to have value are blues, jazz (not big band), early country, folk and some ethnographic recordings. [More details on what we buy.](/sell-trade)

**Do you do appraisals for the purposes of insurance or estate valuations?**\
Yes. Call the store (617 492-0693) to get details and arrange a date.

**Are you able to special order items?**\
No — while we do carry some new items, we don’t deal with distributors and can’t acquire something specific that way. We do get new inventory every day and you’re welcome to call periodically if you’re having a hard time tracking down an out-of-print title.
